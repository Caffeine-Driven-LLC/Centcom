# Centcom

Command many hands. A terminal-first, multiplayer platform for running coding agents: several people and several agents in one workspace, over LAN or a hosted relay. Mascot: **Cento** the octopus.

> Status: planning complete, building starts at gate G0. See [`plan/`](plan/README.md).

## What is in this repo

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| [`plan/`](plan/README.md) | The build plan: 100 backend lanes + 100 client lanes, architecture, strict guidelines, integration gates |
| [`contracts/`](contracts/README.md) | Frozen connection points shared with the backend repo (REST, WebSocket, events, crypto, LAN, billing) |
| [`assets/DESIGN.md`](assets/DESIGN.md) | Design system: brand, mascot, colour, type, motion, components, voice, accessibility |
| [`assets/theme/`](assets/theme) | Abyss/Shallows theme: tokens, CSS, Tailwind preset, terminal themes, live preview |
| [`assets/mascot/`](assets/mascot) | Cento: 319 animations, 5 colours, crowds, gallery, terminal player |
| [`assets/The-Lines.txt`](assets/The-Lines.txt) | 743 spinner lines |
| `tools/plan/` | Plan, contract and lock tooling |

The server lives in the private repo `Caffeine-Driven-LLC/Centcom-backend`; both repos carry identical `contracts/`, `plan/` and `tools/plan/`.

## Try the mascot

```bash
cd assets/mascot
python3 play.py --tour                 # every animation in your terminal (true-colour terminal)
python3 play.py typing --color red     # one animation, any of 5 colours
xdg-open gallery.html                  # browse, recolour, tile into crowds
```

All generated GIFs (5 colours + duo/trio/squad/group crowds) are committed under `assets/mascot/gif/`; regenerate with `python3 assets/mascot/build.py`.

## Check the plan and contracts

```bash
python3 tools/plan/validate_contracts.py
python3 tools/plan/validate_plan.py
python3 tools/plan/lock.py --check
```
